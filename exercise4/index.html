        <div id="content_left">My name is Haque. I am from Bangladesh. I have done BSc in Leather Engineering from University of Dhaka, 
            Bangladesh. Previously I used to do private tutoring and after graduation I started to work in production sectors 
            ( Leather goods and footwears) at the supply chain departments. Recently, I found interest in ICT so did some searches and 
            here I am hoping to move to Finland soon. Currently, I am living with my parents and mostly spend time at my elder sister and 
            her wonderful little daughter. I like to spend time with my friends. Recently, I went touring with couple of my friends and visited 
            some new places, did boat riding, swimming, shopping, met new people and so on. Long train journey always fascinated me.

        <div id="content_right"> Upon completion of my primary education, I got admitted to a military residential school named Rangpur Cadet 
            College. Because of the strict administration and disciplined environment, this is recognized as one of the most leading institutions 
            of our country. From there, I completed the Secondary and Higher Secondary School Certificate examinations respectively with the most 
            exemplary results. Besides, I was awarded the government scholarship because of the brilliant results in the Secondary School 
            Certificate examination (10th grade). Since my childhood, I have been associated with various extra-curricular activities which 
            triggered me to be versatile irrespective of culture and position.
